Configuring bucket access
Custom domains

When a custom domain is connected to your bucket, the contents of your bucket will be made publicly accessible through that domain. Websites connected can also benefit from Cloudflare features such as bot management, Access, and Cache. Learn more


R2.dev subdomain

When you enable r2.dev access, anyone on the Internet can use the public r2.dev URL to view objects in this bucket. However, usage is rate-limited and is not recommended for production. Also, Cloudflare features such as Access and Cache will not be available. Learn more
View R2.dev Bucket URL

CORS policy

Configure CORS headers that R2 will set when accessing this bucket's contents from a browser.

Configure CORS policy

Build rich client-side web applications and selectively allow cross-origin access to your bucket by setting up a CORS policy. Learn more

Incremental migration

Continuously migrate data from an Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage bucket to this bucket only as read requests are made.

Using Sippy
When incremental migration is enabled, read requests initially target your R2 bucket. If an object is absent, it is served from the specified external source bucket, and simultaneously replicated into your R2 bucket.
